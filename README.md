  SEEK Australia Job Listing
</h1>

**Project Description**: This is a dashboard made with Tableau with content about recruitment statistics posted on SEEK - one of the largest employment marketplace sites in Australia. Using Tableau allows users to spend less time creating graphs and images. Besides, Tableau uses algorithms to intelligently understand and format data-based charts, handling most of the heavy lifting and complexities in data analysis. One limitation in this personal project is that it is not yet published on Tableau Public for everyone to use, but this will be fixed soon in the future.
Dataset is open data collected from [here](https://data.world/promptcloud/30000-job-postings-from-seek-australia)
